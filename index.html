    things i love animals for sure especially cuddly ones, my friends ily all, my boyfriend <3, the color pink
    things to know i keyboard spam, tired 25/8, realllyy talkative, i have terrible typing skills, easily distracted, 
    can talk abt like anything, easily forgetful, might have to remind me abt things very often
    do not interact if youre like a crazy dry typer (im really bad at tone reading), super mean but like not jokingly
    mean just straight up rude, if youre racist or homophobic stay away (ew) um if youre just like super judgy on purpose or like a major asshole
    my interests i like reading sometimes, i do art & concepts, i love spending money on whatever so like yeah !! random people messaging me to be
    friends, nice people, when youre encouraging...more to know my personality fluctuates a lot but in general im pretty much the same way for everyone, 
    i may start mirroring the way you talk, im easy to talk to and very open, im also very trusting ( dont take advantage of this )-->
